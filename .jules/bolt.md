## 2026-04-13 - [Initial Performance Review]
**Learning:** Found that all page components are statically imported in App.tsx, causing the entire application (including the internal operator console) to be loaded upfront even for public users.
**Action:** Implement route-based code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense to improve initial load performance.

## 2026-04-20 - [Optimizing Console Responsiveness]
**Learning:** Search filtering in the Signal Queue was blocking the main thread, causing input lag. Additionally, redundant `new Date()` allocations inside render loops created unnecessary GC pressure.
**Action:** Implemented `useDeferredValue` for search terms to prioritize input responsiveness. Refactored date formatting to pass raw numeric timestamps directly to `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, avoiding redundant object allocations.

## 2026-04-21 - [Effective Memoization Patterns]
**Learning:** Found that several large UI components (like `SignalDeskHeader`) were wrapped in `React.memo`, but their parent components were passing unstable inline arrow functions as props, causing them to re-render on every keystroke in nearby input fields.
**Action:** Stabilized navigation and scroll handlers using `useCallback` in `IntakePage` and `StatusPage`. Memoized the static `SignalFooter` and complex `StatusTimeline` to further reduce the virtual DOM diffing overhead during high-frequency updates.

## 2026-04-22 - [Optimizing List Rendering via Component Isolation]
**Learning:** Found that `useDeferredValue` alone doesn't prevent the re-evaluation of complex JSX trees in the same component. Even if data doesn't change, React still diffs the entire tree on parent re-renders unless children are memoized components receiving stable props.
**Action:** Extracted and memoized the Signal Queue table into dedicated components. Stabilized event handlers with `useCallback` to ensure the memoization remains effective during high-frequency state updates like typing.

## 2026-04-23 - [Referential Stability Cache Pattern]
**Learning:** `useMemo` is often used for array indexing/transformation, but recreating derived objects in the loop breaks `React.memo` in downstream list components. If the parent array is recreated (common with state updates), every child re-renders even if its individual source data hasn't changed.
**Action:** Implemented a manual referential stability cache using `useRef` inside `useMemo`. By comparing raw source references, we can preserve exact derived object identities for unchanged items, enabling effective list-wide memoization even when the parent state is updated.

## 2026-04-26 - [Optimizing Submission Pipeline and LCP]
**Learning:** Sequential network requests in form submission block the user-perceived transition to success states. Additionally, missing dimensions on critical brand assets cause layout shifts and late prioritization by the browser.
**Action:** Parallelized independent webhooks using `Promise.all` and added explicit `width`, `height`, and `loading="eager"` to the primary logo in the header.
